1.0.1 2024-08-30
---------------
Take Tom Keffer's fix for ghost values when using Vantage Vue.

1.0 2024-08-24
--------------
Incorporate upstream changes related to configuring the vantage device.

0.13 2023-11-05
---------------
Assure getTime returns proper timestamp even during DST transition.

0.12 2022-12-22
---------------
Remove Python 2 compatability.

0.11 2022-11-07
---------------
Remove dup pkt elminination.  These packets with the same timestamp are "almost"
identical; but just almost.  Better to keep them.  The duplicate timestamps
do not present an issue for weewx (as evidenced by WeeWX's vantage driver
serving duplicte timestamps for many years.

0.10  2022-11-05
----------------
- Adjust getTime if it's about to return a time of one hour off to weewx.engine (DST).
- Prevent duplicate packets (which often occur after an archive period because the
  loop is restarted all within the same second as the last packet delivered).
  Not a big deal, but averages will be ever so slightly off with the extra packet.

0.9 2022-10-16
--------------
Don't bother checking for duplicate packets.


0.8 2022-10-16
--------------
- Fix bug where driver can send a duplicate loop packet after processing an archive record.
- Retry in genLoopPackets on WeeWxIOError.
- Pick up WeeWX bug fix:
  Fix problem that causes `leafWet3` and `leafWet4` to be emitted in VP2
  stations that do not have the necessary sensors.

0.6 2022-02-12
--------------
- If during time change period, check if archive record's time is misinterpreted
  to be an hour ahead or an hour behind.  Auto adjust to fix this.
  Fixes DST change errors.

0.51 2021-12-26
---------------
- Add time_set_goal for setting time (see README).

0.5 2021-12-25
--------------
- New calculation when setting clock.  day_start_jump
  is also used in the calculation (see README).

0.4 2021-12-xx
--------------
- Code cleanup.

0.3 2021-08-07
--------------
- Pick up WeeWX bug fix for LOOP2 windGust10.
  See: https://github.com/weewx/weewx/commit/11b795ba457cd5603803438a21d5e2055e9f3937

0.2 2020-12-??
--------------
- Set time padding varies by time of day with the newly introduced
  clock_drift_secs parameter.  Both set_time_padding (default 0.2s)
  clock_drift_secs (default -2.4s) determine the padding in set_time.

- The day's cumulative rain is now calculated by calling
  weewx.wxformulas.calculate_delta.

0.1 2020-11-15
-----------------
- Initial release.
